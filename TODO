[ ] BUG: SELLING TOWERS NEEDS TO BE DONE VIA MESSAGE.

[ ] Will you create a discord bot for the game where it can post an image in a channel of the current board every 5 seconds and people can use a command with raw position values to place towers?

[ ] Potentially make projectiles fly off into the distance when their target is gone.

[ ] BUGFIX: Sort out the conflict with egui and inspector egui. And make a note of how to fix in the future.

[ ] POTENTIAL BUG: Tile global transform not updated until movement.

[ ] BUGFIX: What is going on with the targeting?
